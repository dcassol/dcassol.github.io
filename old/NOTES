R-Ladies is a worldwide organisation that promotes gender diversity within the R community. The organisation is explicitly LGBTIQ friendly and trans-inclusive, and aims to provide support in across the entire spectrum of roles whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users. In collaboration with Jen Richmond, Lisa Williams, Steph Stammel I helped to co-found the Sydney R-Ladies chapter in 2018, and it’s been one of the most rewarding professional activities I’ve ever been involved in.
