Hi! I’m Daniela Cassol, a bioinformatics computing consultant at the DOE Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I create tools and provide user support to make distributed computational workflows easier, faster, and more fun. I’m originally from Brazil, but I now call the Bay Area home.
